# P0rtFinder

**P0rtFinder** is a powerful and customizable Python-based port scanning tool designed for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and enthusiasts. It helps identify open TCP/UDP ports and associated services on a target system. P0rtFinder also integrates the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), allowing users to run advanced security scripts for vulnerability detection directly from the tool.

## **üñ•Ô∏è Example Commands**
To scan TCP ports from 1 to 100 on a target IP address:
```bash
python P0rtFinder.py example.com -p 1 100 -P tcp
```
```bash
python P0rtFinder.py 0.0.0.0 -p 1 100 -P tcp
```
To scan WordPress site or any other with specific NSE scripts:
```bash
python P0rtFinder.py <wordpress-site> -p 80 443 -s http-wordpress-enum http-wordpress-brute
